'Stuck With You' is a simple, human-first web app designed to help users move forward when they feel mentally blocked.
Instead of tracking productivity or progress metrics, the app provides immediate, low-pressure guidance through small actionable steps and reassurance.

How It Works:
1. The app centers around one main button: “I’m stuck.”
2. When clicked, the user answers a few short prompts about:
    - What they are stuck on (studying, coding, writing, decision-making)
    - How long they have been stuck
    - What they have already tried (using selectable options)
3. Based on these inputs, the app responds with:
    - One small next step
    - One reassuring message
    - One clear example

Key Features:
1. One-click “I’m stuck” interaction
2. Selectable options instead of long text input
3. Small, actionable next steps
4. Reassuring, human-centered responses
5. No tracking, no pressure, no productivity scores

Tech Stack:
1. Python
2. Streamlit
3. JSON (For content handling, if need be)

Planned Enhancements:
1. Randomized reassurance messages
2. Mood-based suggestions
3. Interactive UI elements for better user experience
